## Background

I finished the implementation entirely without RBS and Steep and then I decided to use it to learn RBS, which I haven't used before. Since the implementation was finished it was a nice little experiment to see how much will RBS and Steep help me in uncovering bugs. I did a reasonable effort to work on it as if it was production code, writting tests as I went. The main thing missing to make it like real work and which would have probably caught at least some of the bugs was that no one was reviewing my code.

## The bugs

I kept track of all the bugs that were found by RBS+Steep while adding it:

### With diagnostics set at Lenient

This didn't uncover any bugs.
